## To Run

   npm install

   npm start

## To Build

   npm run build


## TODO

- integrate as new Xena page 


## Data TODO

- add cell-lines 
- add expression data : outlier expression
- add expression driven pathways : e.g. integration with Viper functional analysis 


## Possible TODO

- put gene selection below pathway selection (and then only show the tissue view for genes)
- allow multiple selection of genes / pathways with statistics (gene enrichment)
   - provide combined statistics matches
   - (allow visible selection of fields)
   - put a control / display canvas on top of another one? 
- side-by-side comparison of different analysis
   - provide statistics for comparisons
- allow selection of multiple cohorts (displayed vertically)
- allow selection of different criteria for scoring 
- add different (drill-down) filters for scores, etc. 
- allow different ways to shade, including z-score, only percentage, etc. etc. 
- allow creation of custom pathways sets by selecting available genes (with lookup)
- allow hiding pathways
- show trees for hierarchical clustering 
- show camplot
- show annotations for hovered / selected (are these the functional annotations?)





## Important biological questions

- what genes are involved / dominant in these pathways for 'X' affects 
- what is the combined affect of these genes on various pathways for this set of selected genes
